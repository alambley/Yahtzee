# Yahtzee
An implementation of the popular Yahtzee game in Java SWT, built with Maven.
# How to build
Beyond the standard 'mvn package', you might have to make sure that artifactId of the org.eclipse.swt matches the target system. The current pom works for a Windows system using a 64bit JRE. Changes will have to be made for differing OS's and JRE bit architectures.
